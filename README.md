# IT-Research-in-Practice
This is a data science research project at QUT.<br>

<b>Project Background</b> <br>
<br>
Twitter is one of the most popular social media platforms and different parties are interested about filtering or retrieving the relevant and specified tweets from the twitter. <br>
Most of tweets are short and it is difficult to categorise them meaningfully into areas or domains due to the complexity of understanding and capturing the content. <br>
In most of the existing researches, hash tags and key words-based categorisations are applied. <br>
<br>
<b>Project Objectives</b> <br>
<br>
This project aims to retrieve the related tweets based on the users’ topic interest based on text mining techniques.<br>
Students are required to present an effective algorithm to categorise and retrieve the relevant tweets related to the topics of user’s interest 
based on his/her tweets. <br>
<br>
<b>Research Questions</b> <br>
<ul>
  <li>How to extract the content from the tweets?</li>
  <li>How to extract the topics for each tweet?</li>
  <li>How to match the user’s topic interest with the tweets filtered for different topics?</li>
</ul>
<br>
<b>Deliverables</b> <br>
<ul>
  <li>Paper</li>
  <li>PowerPoint Presentation</li>
  <li>Programming Code</li>
</ul>
